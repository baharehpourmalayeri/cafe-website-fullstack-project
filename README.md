â˜• CafÃ© Website

A modern and responsive cafÃ© website that started as a simple JavaScript project and was later enhanced with React for the frontend and Express.js with SQLite for the backend. 
This project showcases my journey from using JavaScript to adopting modern frameworks for better scalability and maintainability.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Frontend:

âœ… React â€“ UI library for building dynamic components

âœ… React Router â€“ For client-side navigation

âœ… Bootstrap â€“ Styling and responsive design

Backend:

âœ… Express.js â€“ Lightweight backend framework

âœ… CORS â€“ Handling cross-origin requests

âœ… SQLite â€“ Lightweight database for storing data

âœ… SQLite3 â€“ Node.js bindings for SQLite
